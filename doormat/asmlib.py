"""The compiler behind the raw-assembly kernels in this package.

A kernel module -- ``asmx11`` is the only one here -- is a hand-written
``doormat/asm/*.S`` file: raw x86-64, no C, no assembler required at
runtime, compiled on demand into a shared object and called through
``ctypes``. Everything that makes that possible lives here once: the host
and compiler checks, the on-disk cache keyed on the source, and the buffer
wrappers, so a kernel module is only the ctypes plumbing and its fallback.

If there is no compiler, or the host is not Linux/x86-64, every kernel
module falls back to an identical pure-Python implementation so nothing
else breaks.

FeetBrowser has a copy of these forty lines, for its own text-selection
kernel. That is deliberate: the alternative was one package depending on
the other for a call to ``subprocess`` and a hash, and a windowing library
is not where a browser should be getting its assembler from.
