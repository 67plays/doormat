"""The X11 framebuffer-packing kernel in raw x86-64 assembly, ctypes-loaded.

The X11 backend beside this file converts a caller's packed RGB
framebuffer into the X server's Z-format through ``_pack_generic`` whenever
the TrueColor visual is depth 15 or 16: one Python loop per pixel, three
256-entry lookup tables and an endian-aware ``to_bytes`` each. This module
is what that loop is when you stop pretending, hand-written in the machine's
own language in ``doormat/asm/x11pack.S``, compiled on demand, called
through ``ctypes``.

The compilation, the on-disk cache and the host/compiler checks all live in
``asmlib.load_assembly``; this module is only the ctypes plumbing and the
fallback, which is byte-identical to the loop it replaces.

If there is no compiler, or the host is not Linux/x86-64, the kernel falls
back to that pure-Python loop so nothing else breaks.
